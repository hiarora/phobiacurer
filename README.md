Curing   Phobias using Virtual Reality

This project aims to pacify/alleviate user's fears using an augmented reality device (Microsoft Hololens).

Description:
Using the HoloLens, we be able to slowly expose patients to the object of their phobias in a controlled setting.
Measuring the user’s heart rate, we will have data on how much fear the user is currently experiencing, and adjust the vividness of the virtual object they are viewing accordingly. 
In a virtual medium, not only is the patient assured they won’t be in danger from their real fears, they can slowly get accumulated to their phobias, which is the whole point of desensitization therapy.
